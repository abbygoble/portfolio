Project Title: Old Fart Clothing Company Portfolio Piece

Public Frameworks of Bootstrap and Purecss have been utilized.
Primary framework is Bootstrap
Purecss is used to format button on about page

Due to lack of clothing items having been produced by company at time of coding, most images are not personal property.  However, as clothing items are created, placeholder images will be replaced.
