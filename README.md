Project Title: Old Fart Clothing Company Portfolio Piece

The process of creating this portfolio was one of ups and downs.  Having never done a bootstrap assignment of this size, there was certainly a lot to learn and adapt around.  The primary issue that I faced was that the various screen sizes were not easily adapted to be made responsive, so I had to instead work with a lot of display none's and block displays within different viewports.  I'm really proud of the complexity of the layout of this site, as it was very challenging and time consuming to figure out, but I think in the end it turned out nicely.  In making this portfolio, I was once again reminded of how time consuming a project of this size is, and that however much time you think it will take, you should allot to give yourself double.  That way when problems arise (which they will) you have time to solve them without the added pressure of a time crunch.

Public Frameworks of Bootstrap and Purecss have been utilized.
Primary framework is Bootstrap
Purecss is used to format button on about page

The google font Josefin Sans was used as the primary font for the logo and all stylistically decorated text.

Within the Wireframes folder you can find all of the high fidelity wireframes which the site were based around.
